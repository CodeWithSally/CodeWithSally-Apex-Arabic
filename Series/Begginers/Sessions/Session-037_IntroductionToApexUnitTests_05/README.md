# Session 037 - Apex Unit Testing (Part 5): Test.startTest, Test.stopTest & System.runAs

This session is the **final part** of the Apex Unit Testing series for beginners. We focused on advanced, but essential, testing techniques every developer should know.

## ✅ What We Covered

- 🔹 **Test.startTest & Test.stopTest**: What they do, when to use them, and why they're important for isolating code and governor limits.
- 🔹 **Live demo** using `GovernorLimitsDemoTest.cls` to show how `startTest/stopTest` impact limits and execution.
- 🔹 **System.runAs**: When and how to use it to test behavior for different users or profiles.
- 🔹 **Live demo** using `AccountServiceTest.cls` and `TestDataFactory.cls` to simulate user-based logic.
- 🔹 Reviewed **key takeaways** from the entire unit testing series.
- 🔹 Suggested **homework** for viewers to continue practicing their skills.
