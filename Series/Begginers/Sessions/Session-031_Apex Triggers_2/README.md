# 📌 Session 31 - Apex Triggers (Part 2) - Context Variables & Bulk Processing

## 🔍 **Session Overview**
In this session, we continue our **Apex Triggers journey** by exploring **context variables**, **bulk insert behavior**, and **real-world trigger implementations** in Salesforce. 

This hands-on session covers:
✔️ **Recap of Part 1**: Reviewing trigger basics and correcting the number of trigger events (7 events).  
✔️ **Trigger Context Variables**: Understanding `Trigger.New`, `Trigger.Old`, `Trigger.isBefore`, `Trigger.isAfter`, and other built-in lists & flags.  
✔️ **Live Coding - 4 Business Requirements**: Attendees guessed the correct trigger type & event, then we implemented and tested each scenario together.  
✔️ **Bulk Insert Simulation**: Demonstrating how triggers execute in bulk by inserting multiple `Account` records at once.  
✔️ **Understanding `Upsert` Behavior**: How `upsert` works for inserting new records vs. updating existing records.  
✔️ **Homework Assignments**: Two additional requirements for attendees to analyze and implement.
