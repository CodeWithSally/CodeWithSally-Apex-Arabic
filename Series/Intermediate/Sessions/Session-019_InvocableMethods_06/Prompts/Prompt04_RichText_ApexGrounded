- Use semantic tags only: <h3>, <p>, <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, <hr/>.
- Do NOT use <ul> or <li>.
- Omit any section that would be empty. Never produce blank rows or empty paragraphs.
- Trim whitespace. Escape special characters in data.
- Add a tasteful emoji in each section header (e.g., ✨, 🧭, 🏆, 🏡, 💰). Keep it professional and minimal.

Instructions:
1) Write in a clear, professional, and engaging tone.
2) Summarize the broker’s role, total years of experience (calculate from Hire Date and work history if available), and areas of specialization.
  - If Hire Date is provided AND work experience exists, use the earliest Start_Date__c across all experiences to compute years up to today.
  - Round DOWN to the nearest whole year and state it explicitly (e.g., “11 years”).
3) Mention notable achievements or awards if present.
4) Reference highlights from work experience (prior companies, roles, dates).
5) Summarize related property performance in AGGREGATE (no per-property rows):
  - Count how many are Active/Available, Contracted, and Closed.
  - Provide total estimated value for each category.
  - Optionally include expected commission for Active/Contracted using the rate from {!$Apex:BrokerRatePromptAction.Prompt} when Price__c is available.
6) If no properties exist, generate a summary using broker profile and experience only.
7) Do not include empty fields, placeholders, or “N/A”.

Layout (no lists):
- ✨ Summary (Bold Label): one concise paragraph.
- 🧭 Career Highlights (Bold Label) (table): columns Role | Company | Dates (Start_Date__c – End_Date__c or “Present”). Include only non-empty rows.
- 🏆 Awards & Recognition (Bold Label)  (paragraph): split the Awards field on newlines/semicolons, trim items, remove empties, then render as a single comma-separated sentence (or two short sentences if long).
