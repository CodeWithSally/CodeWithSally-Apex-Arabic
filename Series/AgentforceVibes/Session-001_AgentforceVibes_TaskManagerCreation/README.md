# 🧠 Agentforce Vibes in Action (Arabic): Build a Task Manager (LWC + Apex)

In this Arabic session, we put **Salesforce Agentforce Vibes** into action to build a complete **Task Manager App** using Apex and Lightning Web Components — all inside **VS Code** with grounded prompts and custom rules.

This session is part of the **Agentforce Vibes Arabic Series**, where we combine AI tools with real-world Salesforce development.

## 🎯 Overview

In this session:
- We reused the same requirements from the English session and built the solution in Arabic step-by-step.
- Wrote **prompt files (.md)** in Arabic with clear structure.
- Grounded prompts using **global/workspace rules** and **local org metadata**.
- Explained how to use **Plan** and **Act** modes wisely.
- Showed how to generate and test **Apex classes, test classes, LWC components, and data seeding scripts**.
- Demonstrated how to **restore from checkpoints** and handle errors during generation.

## 💡 What We Built

1️⃣ **LWC components**  
2️⃣ **Apex controller class**  
3️⃣ **Apex test class**

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

1️⃣ Be clear with your prompt — clarity = better output  
2️⃣ Validate the generated plan before executing  
3️⃣ Use **Act** only when ready — start small
